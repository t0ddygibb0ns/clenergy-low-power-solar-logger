This project provides an Arduino build and software for logging of data from a grid-connected solar system.

It has been developed for a Clenergey SPH-30 inverter, but should work for other Clenergey inverter models.

The project would also be expected to work with little or no modification with a Sunnyroo TLi inverter, and Power King inverter (produced by Powercom), but these have not been tested.
